## Image and Analysis for Detection of Risky Mosquitoes Breeding Sites

### Abstract
The goal is to create a system that uses deep learning to detect whether or not a specific image contains potencial sites for mosquitoes reproduction. This can be applied for preventing diseases spread such as Dengue or Zika. 

Risky sites include areas with still water, for example: water tanks, plant pots, empty bottles and other recipients, car tires, rubble areas.
